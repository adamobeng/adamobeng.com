Thanks to [Introduction to Data Science](http://columbiadatascience.wordpress.com/), and Peter Bearman's Research Design class, I've been thinking about doing science.[1] The Research Design class this week was about the debate between Eric Klinenberg and Mitchell Duneier about the social causes of mortality in the 1995 Chicago Heatwave. One of the problems is that there are many variables and few cases, which makes the sort of statistical analyses usually carried out in sociology quite difficult. Chapter 2 However, data scientists deal with this kind of thing all the time, especially those in industry who are trying to predict a user's purchasing behaviour based on a huge sparse vector of previously visited websites. There are [methods](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-tree-boosting) which can effectively ignore useless variables.

But this predictive accuracy comes at a cost of producing mode
