Thanks to Columbia's [Introduction to Data Science](http://columbiadatascience.wordpress.com/), a few classmates and I got to attend [Strata NY](http://strataconf.com/stratany2012) this week. It's a testament to the class that, barely a couple of months in, I was already familiar with the work quite a few of the presenters.

I went to quite a few of the talks on the dataviz track, and one question that kept coming up was the language[1] of graphics. I asked [Naomi Robbins](http://www.nbr-graphs.com/) about  the use of graphs, like box-and-whisker plot, which are not obvious to the naive reader, but are a pretty efficent for, say, an academic audience. The next day, [LynnCherny](http://www.ghostweather.com/) pointed out that chord diagrams take some non-negligeable knowledge to interpret. In a research design class a few months ago, I was midly berated for suggesting that a resarcher's understanding of their work should not be measured by their ability to vulgarise it, much less by their ability to explain to other people why they should care. My objection was that, of course, we should be able to teach the things we understand, but that interesting research, almost by definition, has to be so esoteric and dependent on previous work that explaining it to a non-specialist loses its essence. Almost by definition, the things that interest specialists require a lot of run up to explain. If it didn't take a few conceptual leaps, then it would probably be obvious, and thus uninteresting.
