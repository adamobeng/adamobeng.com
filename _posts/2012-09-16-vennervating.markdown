Isn't it the most cliched thing to not update a blog for a while, and then apologised for doing so? Well I'm an iconoclast, so that's not likely.

However, quite a few things have happened in the interval: I've finished up at Nuffield (including a thesis about [William Godwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Godwin)'s [Diaries](http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk) about which certainly more anon). I'm now a few weeks into the Ph.D. programme in Sociology at Columbia University (in the City of New York).

As a result of moving to the Capital of The Universe, I'm experiencing some cultural disconnects.

I guess set theory (or at least some of the graphics associated therewith) is now part of popular culture to a sufficient extent that Madison Avenue[1] has got hold of it. Hence, this:

*Full disclosure*: I've had a Speck case on my Mac Book Air since the day I bought it, and it's brilliant.

Let's call these sets C, D and G.

Obviously, the intersection of C and D is the empty set, given that $C=\notD$, so C union D = emptyset. Moreover, all people who used check the slot don't check the slot, so G belongs D. Therefore, the intersection of all three sets --- $C \union D \union G$ where speck is to be found --- is empty. Given that a speck is a small --- perhaps infinitesimally small --- particle, perhaps that's [appropriate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_certain#Throwing_a_dart).

Is this poster a one-off, has anyone seen others on a similar theme?

[1]: I truthfully have no idea if they still produce advertising there, but permit me my mythologised vision of the City.
