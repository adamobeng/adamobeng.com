	<p>Hi!</p>

	<p>I'm Adam Obeng.</p>
	<p>	I like understanding things. Often the best way to understand things is to take them apart and put them back together again.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, socities are much more complicated than your parents' alarm clock.</p>
	<p>So I make models of human societies instead.</p>
	<p>It's easier in the long ru, and you don't have to scrabble round on the floor for hours trying to find the bit that went <em>sproing</em>.</p>
