	<p>Statistical summaries of models are one thing, while actually having a feel for how a model works is another. Agent-based models are inherently dynamic, so there will necessarily be something lost from static pictures of the model, even from graphs of statistics over time. Moreover, ABMs are part of a very quantitative branch of sociology, so it might even be refreshing to reintroduce a little bit of qualitative information, not to mention <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights'>blinkenlights</a>.</p>
	<p>It turns out that the topology of the network does matter, but the reasons why are slightly difficult to determine. In Barabasi-Albert networks, but not in Watts and Strogatz or Erdos-Renyi networks, when the starting proportion acting is around 50\%, the outcomes are very sensitive to the exact distribution of initial actor states.</p>
	<p>That is, in all other models, the proportion acting after 20 rounds of interaction is similar from simulation to ssimulation, but on Barabasi-Albert networks, there seem to be two equilibria of final proportion acting, and which results is dependent on initial conidtions in a way that is not well understood.</p>
	<p>Apart from introducin me to the methods of anayltical sociology, this result in particular reaffirmed my commitment to seek out un-obvious results in sociology.</p>
