	 <h1>Small Worlds, Sour Grapes and Social Deprivation: the Computational Application of Peter Hedström’s DBO Theory</h1>

	 <p>Statistical summaries of models are one thing, while actually having a feel for how a model works is another.</p>
	 <p>Agent-based models are inherently dynamic, so there will necessarily be something lost from static pictures of the model, even from graphs of statistics over time. </p>
	 <p>Moreover, ABMs are part of a very quantitative branch of sociology, so it might even be refreshing to reintroduce a little bit of qualitative information, not to mention some <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights'>blinkenlights</a>.</p>

	<p>It turns out that the topology of the network does matter, but the reasons why are slightly difficult to determine. In Barabási-Albert networks, but not in Watts and Strogatz or Erdos-Renyi networks, when the starting proportion acting is around 50%, the outcomes are very sensitive to the exact distribution of initial actor states.</p>
	<p>That is, in all other models, the proportion acting after 20 rounds of interaction is similar from simulation to simulation, but on Barabási-Albert networks, there seem to be two equilibria of final proportion acting, and which results is dependent on initial conditions in a way that is not well understood.</p>
	<p>Apart from introducing me to the methods of analytical sociology, this result in particular reaffirmed my commitment to seek out un-obvious results in sociology.</p>
