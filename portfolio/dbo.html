	<p>Statistical summaries of models are one thing, while actually having a feel for how a model works is another. Agent-based models are inherently dynamic, so there will necessarily be something lost from static pictures of the model, even from graphs of statistics over time. Moreover, ABMs are part of a very quantitative branch of sociology, so it might even be refreshing to reintroduce a little bit of qualitative information, not to mention <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights'>blinkenlights</a>.</p>
