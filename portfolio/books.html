	<p>One of the aims of the digital humanities is to integrate the use of technology into the everyday work of humanities scholars. Developing tools that are usable and useful requires understanding and dialogue between academics and developers.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/DHSS2011/">Digital Humanities@Oxford Summer School 2011</a> aimed, in part, to facilitate this exchange. Amongst other things, I presented (<a href="http://adamobeng.com/download/dhox/slides">slides</a>) new XSLT transformations which I developed to convert TEI XML <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html//ref-timeline.html">timeline</a> elements to EPUB3 eBook text-synchronised audio. For the presentation, I produced a <a href="http://adamobeng.com/download/dhox/beowulf.epub">demonstration EPUB</a>, for iBooks on the iPad.</p>
	<p>I also developed a tool for producing the TEI timelines which synchronise an audio file with an eBook, called <a href="https://github.com/adamobeng/Lumberjack">lumberjack</a>. The stylesheets I wrote have been integrated into <a href="http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxgarage/">OxGarage</a>, Oxford University Computing Services' document conversion service.</p>
	<p>Two full books which I produced, a facsimile version of <em>Beowulf</em>, and an audio-synchronised version of <em>The Tragedy of Hoffman</em> should be available on the iBookstore soon.</p>
	<p>I am currently working with the English Faculty at Oxford to develop a website which displays annotated versions of Old English texts to assist undergraduates in learning the language. We are currently investigating how best to display different types of note and gloss on a website, a task which has previously mostly been done in paper books.</p>
