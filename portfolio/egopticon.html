	 <h1>Egopticon</h1>

	 <div class="definition">
		 <p>egopticon, n. A construct from which the self can be observed at all times.</p>
		 <p>Etymology: From <em><a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/59915?rskey=LgKBJr&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid">ego</a></em>, 'I', and the suffix <em>-opticon</em> as in '<a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/136920?redirectedFrom=panopticon#eid">panopticon</a>'</p>
	 </div>
	 
	 <p>(It's also a Greek-Latin hybrid compound &mdash; sorry, linguistic prescriptivists).</p>

	 <p>Since moving back to Oxford at the begging of this academic year, I've been recording all of my social interactions using my smartphone. I've logged all the new people I've met, and the topics of many of our conversations. </p>

	 <p>I am currently analyzing the pilot sample 782 records of interaction over 87 days. The next step is to design a webapp I can use to efficiently capture and analyze futher interactions. </p>

	 <p>The eventual aim is to collate these real world interaction data with information about my online communication habits (from email, Facebook, etc.). Why? Because detailed micro-level data on social interactions are hard to find. Also, it might help me work out who are the most productive people to hang out with...</p>
