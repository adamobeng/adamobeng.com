	<p>William Godwin was a British political philosopher, writer and journalist. Over a period of 49 years in the 18th and 19th Centuries, he recorded 64381 instances of co-presence with other people. Obviously, this record is of historical, political, and sociological significance.</p>
	<p>But these data are difficult to analyse both technically and theoretically. The graph below shows those connections which happen more than 40 times between Godwin and his acquaintances (here is an <a href="graph.dot.svg">SVG</a> version, where the nodes are hyperlinked to their biographies.)</p>

	<p>I am currently working with <a href="http://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/profile/mark-philp.html">Mark Philp</a> to analyse the diaries in the context of what is known about Godwin from other sources. In particular, we are investigating gender-based patterns of interaction. However, more context-independent research can also be done, which treats the data as an egonet without any added historical information.</p>

	<p>While the initial <a href="http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/diary/1798-01-01.xml">coding</a> of the diary viewed it as a literary work, the systematic transcription into TEI XML makes it possible to programatically analyse it. The most problematic part of the study so far has been working out which questions to ask...</p>
