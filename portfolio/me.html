	<p>Hi!</p>
	<p>I'm Adam Obeng.</p>
	<p>I like understanding things.</p>
	<p>Often the best way to understand things is to take them apart and put them back together again.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, human societies are more complicated than your parents' alarm clock.</p>
	<p>So I make models of societies instead.</p>
	<p>It's easier in the long run, and you don't have to scrabble round on the floor for hours trying to find the bit that went <em>sproing</em>.</p>
	<p>This website is supposed to give some examples of the things I get up to &mdash; sociological and otherwise. The projects here presented are of varying substantive importance and at different stages of completion, but they should give you a good cross-sectional overview of the types of thing that interest me.</p>
	<p>Some of these projects are silly, some are serious, some are academic and some are practical. Throughout, you should get an impression of the kind of person I am (interested in anything interesting), as well as the kind of work I do (anything interesting). At the moment, I'm waxing sociological, mostly because I'm fascinated by the abstract models used in <a href="diaries.html">social network analysis</a> and <a href="dbo.html">agent-based modelling</a>. But I'm also interested in <a href="27c3.html">the philosophy of FLOSS</a>, the <a href="books.html">digital humanities</a>, making everyday things slightly <a href="beebify.html">easier</a> and, of course, <a href="identity.html">my</a> <a href="egopticon.html">self</a>.</p>
	<p>Some of this information is presented in a more formal manner on my <a href="../download/Adam_Obeng_CV.pdf">CV</a>. If you'd like even more information than that, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@adamobeng.com">contact me</a>.</p>

	<p>Now you know about me, take a look at <a href="index.html">some of the things I've been up to</a>...</p>
