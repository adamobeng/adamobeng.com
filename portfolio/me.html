	<p>Hi!</p>
	<p>I'm Adam Obeng.</p>
	<p>I like understanding things.</p>
	<p>Often the best way to understand things is to take them apart and put them back together again.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, human societies are much more complicated than your parents' alarm clock.</p>
	<p>So I make models of societies instead.</p>
	<p>It's easier in the long run, and you don't have to scrabble round on the floor for hours trying to find the bit that went <em>sproing</em>.</p>
	<p>This website is supposed to give some examples of the things I get up to &mdash; sociological and otherwise. The projects here presented are of varying substantive importance and at various stages of completion, but they should give a good cross-sectional overview of the types of thing that interest me. Some of this information is presented in a more formal manner on my <a href="../download/Adam_Obeng_CV.pdf">CV</a>. If you'd like even more information, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@adamobeng.com">contact me</a></p>
	<p>Still, take a look at <a href="index.html">some of the things I've been up to</a>, and, you know, give me a job...</p>
