	<h1> Tor is Peace, Software Freedom is Slavery, Wikipedia is Truth: The Political Philosophy of the Internet</h1>
	<p>Apart from further demonstrating my ability to write ridiculously long titles, the talk I gave at the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/wiki/Welcome">27th Chaos Communication Congress</a> was my attempt to combine what I knew about political philosophy and FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open-Source Software).</p>

 <p>The two have superficial similarites, like their focus on the names of things ("Don't call us political <em>theorists</em>, we're political <em>philosophers</em>"). My aim was to use the methods and theories of political philosophy to a problem of real practical importance to FLOSS groups: do so-called "restrictive" FLOSS licenses really impose more restrictions on freedom?</p>
 <p>Because I was presenting to an audience of non-philosophers, I omitted some detail of the academic debate, and included quite a few hacker references that were not stricly necessary (but everyone loves <a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd</a> comics!).</p>

 <p>As the <a href="../download/slides.pdf">slides</a> and <a href "../download/lecture.pdf">lecture text</a> show, </p>
