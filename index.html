	<em>Making computers understand people, helping people understand computers</em>

	<br />
	<br />

	This is the website of Adam Obeng, currently of the Departement of Sociology at Columbia University in the City of New York, sometime of St. Anne's and Nuffield Colleges in the University of Oxford. I'm a computational-, analytical- many-adjectived sociologist, occasional philosopher, and full-time nerd. My side-projects tend merge in to my academic projects, which tend to merge into my real life, insofar as that exists.

	<br />
	<br />

	I've spoken a little bit about <a href="./talk-at-CCC/">political philosophy</a>, I've written a little bit <a href="./analytical-sociology-thesis/">about sociology</a>, and I hope to do more of both.

	My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Bacon</a> <a href="http://oracleofbacon.org/">Number</a> is 3 and my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erd≈ës number</a> is as yet undefined (but I'm working on it!).
